The Gaming Room is a complany that was interested in a gamining apllication for use on multiple platforms, as well as be used by multiple players at once. The application would be called "Draw it or Lose it" and would allow a team of players to guess what was being displayed as the image slowly rendered. In order to win, teams owuld get to guess on what was being rendered, however, if they got it wrong, the opposingf team would get a shot to answer. The game was written in Java, with the inclusuion of Maven use for the security aspect. When working on this project, in my opinion, one thing I did well was trying to see the whole picture. Not going down a rabbit hole and getting stuck. When designing software, I tend to try and look at uit holistaclly. I know what I want to accomplish, and I constantly make updates / tweeks along the way and save off a few different branches. This allows for me to merge the good stuff together, and get rid of the stuff that didnt work out so well. There for some reason, always seems to be more of the bad stuff than the good... someday I will hget to a point of it being the opposite, I hope.
